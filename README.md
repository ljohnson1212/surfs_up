# SURFS UP DUDE!!!!
MODULE #9

# CHALLENGE OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This challenge explores the potential of advanced data storage and retrieval to efficently produce an analyis of temperature trends in Oahu, Hawaii. W. Avy requested summary statistics of temperature data for the months of June and December. This data is needed in order to determine if a prospective surf and ice cream shop business can sustainably operate year-round as opposed to a seasonal business.

# DELIVERABLES

Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)

# RESULTS

	1. The average recorded temperature in June is about 75 degrees, which is 4 degrees higher than the average temp in December.
	2. This represents a -5% change in average temperature from June to December
	3. The gap of the max and min temperatures is less in June compared to December. 
	4. June's max and min variance is 21 degrees, while December's max and min is 27 degrees.
	4. June provided a larger count to give us a more accurate analysis.

# RECOMMENDATIONS

	1. While temperature data is very important, I would also analyze other components of the weather including: Percipitation forcasts, wind, and wave predictions. I feel that these are important components of beach and surfing weather. 

	2. I would want to analyze the data in different times of the year. Even though June and December gives some very useful data, Spring Break and the weeks before the school year are popular times for people to visit the beach. I would want to evauate these times as well to see if there is any variance in temperature, wind and percipitation.

	3. Based on the results and analysis, I would recommend they open the surf and ice cream shop.
